## Carousel
Carousel Slide indicates a collection or ‘filmstrip’ of images that move in a stepwise or smooth manner around a central axis. In simple terms, it facilitates the display of two or more pictures in a single space on a website.
The above code helps implement carousel in your PowerApps Portal Apps.

## PowerApps Portal
PowerApps Portal is a tenant of Microsoft Power Platform that allows you to create a powerful new type of experience: external-facing websites that allow users outside their organizations to sign in with a wide variety of identities, create and view data in Microsoft Dataverse, or even browse content anonymously.

# Usage
This code can be downloaded or forked and use in your portal studio. Full tutorial on implementation can be found on my blog [here](https://medium.com/@richardkadey/how-to-implement-carousel-in-power-apps-portal-e2214b010395)
