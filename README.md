# PowerApps-Portal-Carousel-
### Introduction
Building an end to end solution with PowerApps Portal is one thing and giving that solution an artistic design is another. The question is how do you bring out the life in your portal apps website? Well, as easy as it may sound, design is not always easy to come by and designing involves painstaking analysis and multitude of deep dive thoughts.
In this project, I implemented carousel slide show in one of the portal apps I built. The idea is to spark the radiance in my website.

# Terms
### Carousel
Carousel Slide indicates a collection or ‘filmstrip’ of images that move in a stepwise or smooth manner around a central axis. In simple terms, it facilitates the display of two or more pictures in a single space on a website.
The above code helps implement carousel in your PowerApps Portal Apps.

### PowerApps Portal
PowerApps Portal is a tenant of Microsoft Power Platform that allows you to create a powerful new type of experience: external-facing websites that allow users outside their organizations to sign in with a wide variety of identities, create and view data in Microsoft Dataverse, or even browse content anonymously.

# Usage
This code can be downloaded or forked and use in your portal studio. Full tutorial on implementation can be found on my blog [here](https://medium.com/@richardkadey/how-to-implement-carousel-in-power-apps-portal-e2214b010395)
